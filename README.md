# LogisticRegression_Titanic_Dataset
This mini project was created to learn and implement Logistic Regression Classification using the famous Titanic Dataset, to understand Feature Engineering and apply the concepts to predict the survival of passengers
Here, I have downloaded the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle, and performed Data Cleaning with Feature Engineering and ran Logistic Regression on the dataset as a Classification problem.
